## What is Katsura Imperial Villa? ##
Katsura Imperial Villa is a former detached palace, or tetreat.
Aloingside the villa flows the Katsura River.
This suburb of the city was once remot countryside, fairly far from Kyoto City, and hence a very quiet and comfortable place to live secretly for a member of the aristocracy.
Area: 69,000 square meters.
The villa is famous for its migration-style garden / strolling garden, which means you can enjoy walking from one garden to another across bridges.
Four seasons of the nature.
Elegant buildings are among the finest examples of the Sukiya Style of the Edo Period, 1603 to 1868.

## History of Katsura Imperial Villa ##
Constructed in the mid-17th century, early in the Edo Period.
Used to be called "Katsura Sanso"
The villa was planned by Hachijo no Miya Tomohito and completed by his son.
Tomahito adopted a Sukiya-shoin mixed style including teahouses, a Japanese style study and gardens, etc.
The family Hachijo itself declined and broke apart in 1881, and the name of the villa changed three times, Kyogoku no Miya, Katsura no Miya and Katsura Imperial Palace.
