Analysis and Reflection -- Time in Experiential Space

In this article, Tuan is arguing space has temporal meaning. He uses the example of hopi space and time,  and introduces the concept of distance. Then he uses distance to distinguish the subjective and objective and indicate where is the borderland between subjective and objective. Tuan is giving examples in different fields to prove space has temporal meanings. For example, the picture window facing to the open horizontal space means the bright future. In day to day life, going to work, facing to unknown problems means future; returning home after work with familiar route, familiar places means past time. 

My question is time in experiential space is limited and not accurate. Since it is subjective experience of time, it would be blurred and lack of information. These types of time only include past and future, will not include present. Thus it is incomplete and no continuity.
