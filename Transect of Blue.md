### reaching high, touching the blue

*"When ground is so flat, the sky is becoming low; when feet on
the ground is so firm, there must be a dream reaching high;
When freedom of life is in shackles, the blue of soul will be
overbriming the sky"*

*--David Yang*

###### Introduction

Our site is at the end of Mississippi delta, westeast of City New Orleans. It was a oil draining field before. RIght now is a vast wild land with rivers and bayous crossing through. it is facing some problems including polluted environment, sea level rise, local culture and economy decreasing...

###### What is Blue?

When we heard the word __blue__, the most common reaction would be it is a music type, it is the depression of the mood. However, how does the blue interpretate these meanings?  

When you are listening the traditional blue music, you will find there are essential two cores in it -- the high and the low, no matter its lyric or rythm. The high is its expression of the girl you love, your dream, your passion; the low is the failure, the reality, the depression of life. 

Emerging the blue into the ground of mississipi delta. The high is the force, the tension, the thermal heat, the rich oil resource. The low is being sucked, ruined,  the weakness, the sinking. 

However, imagine you are at the lowest moment of your life, depressed, frustrated. Try to take step back and re-experience and rethinking about it. You will find the sense of relief, the freedom, and a huge tension trying to push you up. That moment redefines the blue.

*"Blue is the lowest low, there is no way fall lower than
that. Thus, it becomes the most solid place with strongest
tension and power to forcing up and reaching high"*

As human on the earth, what is the blue to us? Imagine the black slavors working on the field. Even through they can not fly, they neither can fall lower then the ground. The  ground is the lowest low. The ground is the blue. When the feet on the ground is so firm, there is a force to support standing up, building high, launching rocket to the moon. The blue is the ground.

###### Extend the Blue Up

However, the ground is vanishing. Since the increasing sea level rise, the flat land on mississipi delta has being erosed and drained. In next 10 years, our groud on site will also graduately swollend by salt water. How to save our ground?

Learning from the labor working model, the surface can be generated and elevated through certain systematic framework. Through this concept, the ground also can be extended and up raised. 

Through modeling the combination of  site condition and the systematic structural framework, the space created start to telling a story of the site. Especially the wrapping space defined by power lines, forest boundaries and track mark of the land. Since the gesture of wrapping, there will be a moment of the lowest low in the center. No mater which direction you go, you will get higher. The shape of this space also like a huge amplifier, when the sound generated from lowest low, then it will all bouncing towards up to the sky. A music performence amphitheater will be designed in this place.

Under the slope of the wrapping surface, a research center building will be designed. Since its special location between dense forest and open landscape, it becomes the transition inbetween. The concept of this architecture is letting the architecture and nature to extend into each other. Extending the nature forest into architecture forest, extending the architecture surface into the open landscape.

Along the power lines, there is a tunnel space was created among the tree canopies and power poles. A skybridge will be designed in this space. It creates certain moments of calling and responding to the lower wetland boardwalk.
