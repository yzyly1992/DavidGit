Analysis and Reflection -- Defining Place

This article is arguing the definition of place in different aspect. Author believes place has three fundamental meanings: Location, Locale and Sense of place. Location means the abstract geological coordination. Locale means the objective settings and material quality of the space. Sense of place is much more personal subjective experience and memory of a place. Then author distinguish place to other similar concepts including space and landscape. He believes space is continuous and have areas and volumes allowing movement, and place is the pause of space. Landscape is perspective, is what we look at city remotely.

As a landscape designer, we see landscape in a more broader definition. First, landscape is not only a frame of a view, a picture or a perspective. It is a "three dimensional concrete sharing space". It has spatial quality and tactile quality which is similar to definition of "locale". Then modern landscape also contains designer's ideas and thoughts. It creates personal experience, recalls memory or expects future. It also can call sense of place. Thus, landscape has same three fundamental aspects as place. Landscape should categorized as a type of place.
