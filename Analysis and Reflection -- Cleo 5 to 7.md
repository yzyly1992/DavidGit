Analysis and Reflection -- Cleo 5 to 7

The film is talking about singer Cleo's behavior on an afternoon waiting on her cancer test results. With change of Cleo's emotion, the places, the environment, and the surrounding people are changing too. 

It is interesting to analyze how director using space and frame to indicate Cleo's emotion change. At beginning when Cleo in a fancy store, in his large luxury house, or in taxi with lucky-number, she was isolated from surrounding, and her behavior was limited by all kinds of rules, principles, and schedules. Her life in these spaces was a lie. However, when she moving to a park she never seen, when she first time taking a bus, her life and emotion started to get to the ground, to find broader field, and to rise up new hope and possibility to life. 

What is the different between taking taxi and taking bus. Taxi usually drives from point to point in a shortest road and fastest way. The space in taxi is limited and enclosure. Passenger will be isolated and lost connection to the outdoor world. However, bus will drive to all the popular spots and pause to let passengers flow. Bus has a strong connections to the city, and to other people.
