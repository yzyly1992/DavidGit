Analysis and Reflection -- Mystery Train

The film is talking about 3 different stories happened in same places in Memphis. And the three timelines are same and intercrossing. First one is a Japanese couple traveling to Memphis to chase rock star. The second is an Italian widow stranding in the city overnight. The last one is a three-man's story about gunshot and escape. 

In this film, there are many scenes showing characters walking in the city, through a street, through a crossroad, through an open land with high dense urban building background. What do these clips mean? What does the director want to express? One potential thought is that director want to show how different people look, use and think about city of Memphis. Then, comparing and contrasting these connections to the city to seek the meanings of the city Memphis to different people.
